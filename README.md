>**Context**: We are building a client-only android app called "RockPaerScissors'. Since we are building a prototype for demo, please use  Flutter, the simplest  config, and environment set up. We will demo it on an android emulator and Pixel 8 Pro device. At each major decision, please explain the decision before execution. Update the project under /Users/xicheng/AndroidStudioProjects/RockPaperScissorV2 as  we will build and play the app using Android studio's SDK and tools (we are not using xcode). Before updating the existing files, consider resulting the default setting generated by Android Studio. We are making this project on a Mac that has installed Android studio, Java 21, and basic SDKs.

>**Task**:
>Develop an Android app that allow two users play rock paper scissors. When the game starts. The first screen splits in half, the top half is for Player A, the text and view is upside down so the Player A can see the selection from opposite direction from Player B. When the game starts, Player A can see the options and Player B side is hidden,  'Player A' can choose from: rock, paper, and scissors. The app will remember the choice and flip to the screen for 'Player B' (Player A side is hidden) to choose from: rock, paper, scissors. After the selection, the app hide both options and start a 3-second count down timer (the count down number is in very large font size is the only thing user can see). After the count down, both sides reveal, the result will show players' choices and the result (one of the player wins, the other loses, or tie) and the players' choice. There's a button to restart the game.

>For selection of rock, paper, and scissors, please use emoji ✊, ✋, and ✌️ so that we don't have to create image files. Make them big (two larger than main buttons) so it's easy for users to see and select them.
